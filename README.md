# In-depth-feature-engineering-of-the-Titanic-Dataset-using-various-ML-algorithms-incliuding-RF-ANN
 Titanic Dataset is a very old dataset that is still used for rigorous data analysis to find new insights. In this project, the goal was to do meaningful and strong feature engineering and implementing various Machine Learning algorithms including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, KNN, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Linear SVC and many more. Then compare the results. The project is still ongoing.
